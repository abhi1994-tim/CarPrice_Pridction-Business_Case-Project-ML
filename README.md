# CarPrice_Pridction-Business_Case-Project-ML
In the context of car price prediction, we systematically analyzed the dataset to identify segmented behavioral patterns. This involved data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the application of machine learning algorithms to predict prices. Additionally, we assessed the model accuracy to ensure the reliability of our predictions.
